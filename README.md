# About
This project can be used to parse and get FIT files to get and compute information about:
- Activities like cycling, running, swimming or climbing.
- Monitoring data from watches like Garmin Fenix 6s.

After parsing a FIT file the result will be inside Pydantic's models.

This is a hobby project and it's only been tested with FIT files from Garmin Edge 530 and Garmin Fenix 6s.
